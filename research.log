In this updated version, I've:

Enhanced the prompts for each agent to be more specific and directive, aiming to get more detailed responses from GPT-4.
Included the POOLINSERT cache in the prompts for cross-referencing, as per the system rules.
Feel free to run this updated code, and let me know if you have any further questions or need additional clarifications!

Ideas to give agents a full access to a directory full of NFL data and then slect data how do we take commands and execute them from gpt4 model part one of 5 ideas
ChatGPT
Certainly! To give the agents full access to a directory full of NFL data, you can use Python's built-in os library to list all the files in the directory and then load them into a data structure that the agents can access. You can then use GPT-4 to generate commands to select and manipulate this data.

Here's how you can do it:

Part 1: Load the NFL Data into a Data Structure
First, let's load all the CSV files from a directory into a dictionary of Pandas DataFrames.

python
Copy code
import os
import pandas as pd

# Initialize a dictionary to hold all the NFL data
nfl_data = {}

# Specify the directory where all the NFL data CSV files are stored
data_directory = "/path/to/nfl_data/"

# Load all CSV files into the dictionary
for filename in os.listdir(data_directory):
    if filename.endswith(".csv"):
        filepath = os.path.join(data_directory, filename)
        nfl_data[filename] = pd.read_csv(filepath)
Part 2: Update GPT-4 Prompts to Include Data Selection Commands
You can update the GPT-4 prompts to include a command for selecting specific data files or data points from the loaded NFL data.

python
Copy code
# ... (previous code remains the same)

# Generate a prompt for GPT-4
messages = [
    # ... (previous messages remain the same)
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Agent 7, based on the available NFL data files: {list(nfl_data.keys())}, which file should we focus on for in-depth analysis?"},
]

# Make the GPT-4 Turbo API call
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-4",
  messages=messages
)

# Extract the selected file from the GPT-4 response
selected_file = extract_selected_file(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])  # You'll need to implement this function

# ... (remaining code stays the same)
Part 3: Execute Commands from GPT-4
To execute commands from the GPT-4 model, you can parse the GPT-4 output to identify specific commands and then execute them using Python code.

python
Copy code
# Function to extract and execute commands from GPT-4 response
def execute_gpt4_commands(gpt4_response):
    # Parse the response to identify commands (you'll need to implement the parsing logic)
    commands = parse_commands(gpt4_response)
    
    for command in commands:
        if command == "select_file":
            # Execute the command to select a specific NFL data file
            selected_file_data = nfl_data[selected_file]
        # Add more command execution logic here

# Execute the commands from the latest GPT-4 response
execute_gpt4_commands(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
This is just the first part of the idea. You can extend this to include more advanced data manipulation commands, analytics, or even machine learning model training based on the GPT-4 suggestions.




User
this gotta be formted right tho             {"role": "user", "content": f"Agent 7, based on the available NFL data files: {list(nfl_data.keys())}, which file should we focus on for in-depth analysis?"},

and allow model to select things, go back, cd, search and stuff. one by one. so design that prompt now and also the simulated TUI for the model
ChatGPT
Certainly! To create a Text-based User Interface (TUI) that allows the GPT-4 model to interact with the directory and select files, you can design a series of prompts and responses that simulate a command-line interface. The model can issue commands like select, go back, cd, and search, and your code can execute these commands.

Here's how you can design the prompt and the simulated TUI:

Designing the Prompt
The prompt can be designed to list the available commands and data files, asking the model which command it wants to execute or which file it wants to focus on.

python
Copy code
# Generate a prompt for GPT-4
messages = [
    # ... (previous messages remain the same)
    {"role": "system", "content": "You can issue the following commands: select, go back, cd, search."},
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Agent 7, based on the available NFL data files: {list(nfl_data.keys())}, which command would you like to execute or which file should we focus on for in-depth analysis?"}
]
Simulated TUI for the Model
To simulate a TUI, you can create a function that takes the GPT-4 response, parses it to identify the command, and then executes the command.

python
Copy code
# Function to execute commands from GPT-4 response
def execute_gpt4_commands(gpt4_response):
    # Parse the response to identify commands
    command = parse_command(gpt4_response)  # You



User
way longer prompt with 3 examples how to use the TUI To search like super long and formatted that with markdown so model see it like a tui
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can create a more detailed prompt that includes examples and markdown formatting to simulate a TUI. This will help the model understand how to interact with the interface. Here's how you can design such a prompt:

python
Copy code
# Generate a detailed prompt for GPT-4
messages = [
    # ... (previous messages remain the same)
    {"role": "system", "content": """## Text-based User Interface (TUI) for NFL Data Analysis
You are now in the TUI mode. Below are the commands you can issue:

- `select [filename]`: To select a file for in-depth analysis.
- `go back`: To go back to the previous directory.
- `cd [directory_name]`: To change the current directory.
- `search [keyword]`: To search for files or directories containing the keyword.

### Examples:

1. **To select a file named `player_stats.csv` for analysis:**
    ```
    select player_stats.csv
    ```
2. **To change the current directory to `2021_season`:**
    ```
    cd 2021_season
    ```
3. **To search for files containing the keyword `tackle`:**
    ```
    search tackle
    ```

Based on the available NFL data files: {list(nfl_data.keys())}, which command would you like to execute or which file should we focus on for in-depth analysis?"""
    }
]
This prompt provides the model with a markdown-formatted guide




User
explain to the model this is a TUI demo guide and to interace with the TUI like in hte guide plz
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can include a specific note in the prompt to inform the model that this is a TUI demo guide and that it should interact with it as described in the guide. Here's how you can modify the prompt:

python
Copy code
# Generate a detailed prompt for GPT-4
messages = [
    # ... (previous messages remain the same)
    {"role": "system", "content": """## Text-based User Interface (TUI) Demo Guide for NFL Data Analysis

**Note: This is a TUI demo guide. Please interact with it as described below.**

You are now in the TUI mode. Below are the commands you can issue:

- `select [filename]`: To select a file for in-depth analysis.
- `go back`: To go back to the previous directory.
- `cd [directory_name]`: To change the current directory.
- `search [keyword]`: To search for files or directories containing the keyword.

### Examples:

1. **To select a file named `player_stats.csv` for analysis:**
    ```
    select player_stats.csv
    ```
2. **To change the current directory to `2021_season`:**
    ```
    cd 2021_season
    ```
3. **To search for files containing the keyword `tackle`:**
    ```
    search tackle
    ```

Based on the available NFL data files: {list(nfl_data.keys())}, which command would you like to execute or which file should we focus on for in-depth analysis?"""
    }
]
This version of the prompt includes a note at the beginning to explicitly tell the model that this is a TUI demo guide and that it should interact with it as described in the guide. This should help guide the model's behavior.
